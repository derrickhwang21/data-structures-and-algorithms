Code Challenge - 15: Merge Sort

### Challenge: Code - Insertion Sort
Write a function that accepts an array of unsorted integers, and returns a sorted array by a recursive mergesort algorithm.


## Approach & Efficiency

##### Approach
We recursively taking in the unsorted input array, divide its length by 2 to partition a left and right halves. The base case for this method is if the array lenth is 1 or less, at which point will return the array.

We then merge the halved arrays by taking in the two halves into a separate method helper. Within it we instatiate a new array with the combined length of both halves and iterate through the combined array while comparing whichever value is lesser in the left or right array index for each index position in the combined array. Whichever is lesser, we place that specific index value of either left or right at that point in the combined array and increment its respective counter to account for any all the values in the halved arrays. If at any point the increment count is greater than its respective original array length, then we can assume the next value to be that of the other half.

##### Efficiency
Since we utilized recursion in merge sort, the time complexity needs to account the time as well when we sort the halved-arrays and o(n) time when we merge the entire array, which will result in a o(nLogn)

The space complexity is o(n) since we are creating a temporary array in every recursive call.
