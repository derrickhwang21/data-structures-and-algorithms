# Unique Characters
Cracking The Coding Interview - Chapter 1 - Question 3
Code Challenge - 18: String permutation

### Challenge: Code - String Permutations
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.


## Approach & Efficiency

##### Approach
Iterating through both input strings and keeping count of how many times the character appears in a character array. 

Then we compare the character array with one another to see if there's a discrepancy. 
##### Efficiency
The time complexity for this code is O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(n).
