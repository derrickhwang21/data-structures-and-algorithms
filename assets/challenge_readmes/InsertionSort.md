CODE: Implement Insertion Sort

### Challenge: Code - Insertion Sort
The implemented InsertionSort class which takes in an unsorted array and returns the array sorted using insertion sort.


## Approach & Efficiency
We begin by identifying the key for our comparison as index i.

While the key is less than the value of index j and greater than position 0, then the key moves one position to the left. The process continues until we reach to a value that is smaller than the key. At which point we change the key to the next index of j and repeat the process until the while condition no longer applies.
