# Linked List
CodeFellows - 401 - Java
CODE: Create a Binary/Binary-Search Tree class
## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

Create a BinaryTree Class
* Define a method for each of the depth first traversals `preOrder`, `inOrder`, `postOrder` which takes in a root node and returns an arryay of the nodes.

Create a BinarySearchTree class
* Define a method `add` that adds a new node in the correct location in the binary search tree
* Define a method named `search` that brings in a value of node, and returns the node with the desired value

## Approach & Efficiency
Created LinkedList and Node class





## API
| Class | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Tree| `preOrder` | which takes in an integer value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the "head" of the list with an O(1) Time performance |
|Tree| `includes(int findValue)` | which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.|
|Tree| `postOrder()` | which takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values in the Linked List. |
|BinarySearchTree| `add` | which takes in a value as target and adds the newValue before the target value. |
| BinarySearchTree| `search` | which takes in a value as target and adds the newValue before the target value. |
| `toIntegerArray()` | which takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values into an integer array. |
| `kthFromEnd(int k)` | which takes in a value and returns the nth value from the end of the returns.. |
| `merge(LinkedList one, LinkedList two)` | which takes in two linked lists and merges both into one linked list. |
| `append(int value)` | which takes in an integer value and adds a new node with that value to the end of the list. |
