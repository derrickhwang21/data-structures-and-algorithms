CODE: Create a Node Class
## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node

 ## Approach & Efficiency
Created LinkedList and Node class

Node class created by substantiating an instance of a Node constructor object

LinkedList class implemented through instance methods "insert", "includes", and "print" and instance property "head"

Upon instantiating the head property, an empty Linked List should be created.

This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to "head" when the lunked list is instantiated

Define a method called "insert" which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the "head" of the list with an O(1) Time performance

Define a method called "includes" which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

Define a method called "print" which takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values in the Linked List.

## API

Java ai API was used to support for system input and output through data streams.
