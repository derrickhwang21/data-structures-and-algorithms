Code Challenge of the day (11/26/2018)for CodeFellows 401 - Java

## Challenge
"Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any built-in methods,
return an array with elements in reversed order."

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach I took is to loop through the array and swap the elements of the array (First element with last element,
swap second element with second to last element, until reaching the middle).

## Solution
